Differences between Ant and                            Maven
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Ant is procedural                  Maven is declarative 
2) Ant tasks are not reusable         Maven goals are reusable
3) Ant does not have any lifecycle    Maven has a lifecycle
4) Ant is build tool                  Maven is Project management as well as build tool
5) Ant uses build.xml                 Maven used POM.xml(project object model)
6) Ant do not uses folder structure   Maven maintains folder structure

if you want build your code you have to execute ant command explicitly.
